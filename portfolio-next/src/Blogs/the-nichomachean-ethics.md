## Introduction

Ethics. What does this word mean? Is being "ethical" a subjective measurement of an action or process? What about morality? In todays age, we, as humans, are very quick to deem someone a good or bad person solely based on how they handle a situation or the way they act. While this is not inherently unfair, it begs the question: is there an objective measurement or litmus test to decipher someones goodness? Well, it turns out that this is not a new question, and has been debated for millenia. Even as early as 384 BC., when Aristotle was born.

Even if it is has been in a very limited capacity, you most likely have heard this name before. Hailed as one of the greatest politicians, philosophers, and scientist to ever exist, Aristotle has certainly made an impact in every society from when he was alive to even current times. He started to make a name for himself in Macedonia, where for 20 years he studied at the Academy of Plato. Upon Plato's death, Aristotle started his own school and research institute^1[He also mentored Alexander the Great during this time]. It was here that Aristotle spread his ideals through writings and papers on a vast array of topics. Perhaps his most influential book (and certainly the most readable one) is _The Nichomachean Ethics_, where he explores iedas of happiness, morality, virtue, pleasure, and friendship. The rest of this blog is intended to sum up the key ideas of each of these parts, but of course there is no substitute for reading the actual book, which I highly recommend.

## The Object Of Life

The first section of the book is used to set up the premise and motivation for the rest of the writing. In it, Aristotle sets up what is essentially a logical proof. He starts by claiming that all action aims towards some good (some end goal). Yet he does not immediately declare what this good is. Instead, it is argued that for its own sake, for if it is not done solely for its own sake, then it must not be the end goal. After exploring and disproving some options, he eventually settles on happiness. Happiness, he argues, is the only good done for its own sake and is in and of itself wholly satisfying.

Before we continue with the rest of the recap, its _very_ important\_ to note that between 384 BC. and now, the meaning of words has changed (obviously). So, when Aristotle declares "happiness" as the end goal of human life, he doesn't necessarily mean happiness in the way that we would currently interpret it. Instead, his idea of happiness, or eudaimonia, would translate to something more like "living well". This makes it easier to understand why he claims that happiness is derived from "virtuous activity of the soul" which equates to acting virtuously.

Virtue is a very overloaded term for what essentially just means moral excellence. This is still a vague definition, even in Aristotle's time. To refine what it means to be virtuous and thus how to be happy, Aristotle explores the two sides of virtue: moral and intellectual.
