## Context

A few days ago a group of researchers released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17033) detailing an algorithm that surpasses any single-source shorted path algorithm in terms of time complexity. Before we dive into the details, its important that we develop a good understanding of the current landscape of these algorithms. Unless you cheated your way through data structures (or just are not a Computer Science student), then you have heard of Dijkstras algorithm. Hopefully, you have also heard of Bellman-Ford as well, although this one is marginally less popular. Both of these algorithms are, or were, considered to be the best options to find the shortest path from one vertex^1[Hence, **single-source** shortest-path], V, on a graph to another vertex on the graph.

At a high level, Dijkstras works like this: from a given starting point, traverse all edges and keep track of the weight of that edge. Then for every vertex you visit, check your accumulated distance travelled. If the vertex has a lower distance travelled, then you know that the path you took to get there is not the shortest. Conversely, if you reach a node and the distance the node has stored is greater than your accumulated distance, then you know that your current path is the shortest (so far). This is pretty intuitive, but heres a picture anyways: ![Simple Dijkstras Flow](/blog-images/dijkstras-plus-plus/simple-dijkstras-flow.png)

Bellman-Ford is a little bit less intuitive as it is meant to handle a corner case: negative edge weights. If we think back to how Dijkstras works, you'll notice that in the case where you have 3 vertices connected by negative weights^2[Or, at the very least the cycle between these 3 vertices have edge weights that sum to $< 0$], there is nothing stopping the algorithm from continuously looping through this cycle until it has a weight of negative infinity, thus guaranteeing the shortest path. This case is solved in Bellman-Ford. Instead of just doing one pass through the graph, this algorithm iterates multiple times over each vertex. The key insight is that any true shortest path can use at most $Vâˆ’1$ edges^3[Where $V$ is the total number of vertices in the graph] since any more edges would signify a repeating vertex and thus a cycle. So Bellman-Ford iterates over all vertices $V-1$ times and updates the shortest distance to every other vertex similar to how Dijkstras does. The kicker is that it runs one final iteration (the $Vth$ iteration) to see if any paths can still be improved. If a path can still be improved at this last iteration, there must be a negative weight cycle somewhere.

The last thing we need to understand before diving into the paper is the time complexity of these algorithms. Since Dijkstras goes through every vertex and edge in the graph while maintaining the "closest" vertices with a min-heap, it has a runtime of $O(V log V)$^4[At every vertex spend $log V$ time adding to the heap]. On the other hand, Bellman-Ford iterates over all edges $V$ times, so the time complexity is $O(VE)$.

## Breaking the Barrier

Now that the context is (hopefully) clear, lets see how a team of researchers beat the status-quo. Since the implementation of Dijkstras uses a heap, which they refer to as the frontier $S$, to track the minimum distance to given vertices, the team derived two key insights:

- A vertex is "complete" if its true minimum distance has been found
- If a vertex is "incomplete" then its shortest path is dependent on a complete vertex in the heap (or a vertex in the heap that will be complete before the current one).
  It follows that the the best way to optimize Dijkstras is by minimizing the frontier, which is where Bellman-Ford comes in.

Given an arbitrary upper bound $B$, we can define $U$ as the set of all vertices that have a minimum length $< B$ and the shortest path between the source and that vertex go through some vertex in $S$. Then, select a parameter $k$ such that $k = log^{\Omega{(1)}} n$ to be a threshold between choosing to run Bellman-Ford or Dijkstras on the set of vertices in $S$. Formally, there are two cases:

1. $|U|/k > |S|$ -> $S$, the frontier, is already small enough.
1. $|U|/k \leq |S|$ -> $S$ is too large.

When $S$ is too large, it can be decreased by $k$ iterations of Bellman-Ford from vertices in $S$. By doing so, all vertices with a shortest path from a vertex in $S$ that has $< k$ edges will be "complete". This will leave $|U|/k$ vertices, or pivots^5[The vertices leftover are referred to as _pivots_ since the shortest path to other vertices depends on them], putting us at the same size frontier as the first conidition.

To tie things together, once the frontier is reasonably small ($ < |U|/k$), the algorithm imploys a divide-and-conquer approach
